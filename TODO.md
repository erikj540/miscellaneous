Stuff To Do:
(1) Write better documentation for PrepareData class
(2) Tests for new PrepareData class
(3) Tests for cost calculation
(4) Make cost calculation a module/class(?) and make it so quartiles can be picked
(5) Function that walks through all W*.csv files and for each file outputs file name and how many of various attributes including derived ones like demand are zero...  Need to take out OK=0 data and maybe data for which price=0
(6) Make sure PrepareData is outputting right
(7) Ask Gennady how things should be passed in PrepareData (e.g., not as self.data?)
(8)


DESCRIPTIVE STATS
(1) Module of functions, one for each plot/output json
(2) Separate functions for calculations and outputs because some outputs may use same calculations
(3) Do this in new "descriptite_stats" git branch

K-S STATS MODULE
(1) Use scipy
(2) Read wiki

LEARNING
(1) Updata sharelatex git page with basics that I use often from two references webpages
